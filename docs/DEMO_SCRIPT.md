# 5-Minute Demo Script (Fairathon Submission)

Use this structure when recording your demo video. Keep it tight; judges remember **emotional hook** and **clarity of FairScore integration**.

---

## Minute 0–1: The problem (hook)

- **Optional:** Start with a “bad” allocation (manual list, sybil infiltration), then switch to Fair Allocator resolving it: “Watch as FairScore filters out low-rep applicants in seconds.”
- **60%+** of airdrops deliver negative ROI (FairScale data).
- Grants and allowlists are **gamed**; sybil farming is rampant.
- **&lt;5%** of whitelist participants contribute meaningfully.
- *Line to use:* “Without reputation, we’re funding guesswork.”

---

## Minute 1–2: The solution

- **“We make FairScore actionable.”**
- Fair Allocator turns FairScale’s score into **funding and access decisions**.
- Show **Settings** → committee wallet → **Verify FairScore** → “Create round” and “Export” unlock only when score ≥ 40 or tier ≥ silver.
- *Line to use:* “Reputation isn’t just computed — it’s executable.”

---

## Minute 2–3: Live round

- **Create** a new round (e.g. “Fairathon Demo”), type Grant or Airdrop, set min FairScore (e.g. 50), optional **Weighted allocation**.
- **Add 5 wallets** (paste addresses) → “Add & score” → show ranking, tier, badges, eligible/not, suggested allocation.
- **Simulate min score** — change “If min FairScore = 60” → show how many eligible. *“FairScore drives the outcome in real time.”*
- **Round stats** — point to average FairScore, badge distribution, and overridden % (if any).
- **Risk** — point to 🟢 Healthy / 🟡 Borderline / 🔴 Likely Sybil (purpose-built for anti-farming).
- **Override** — optionally show “Override approved” with reason (governance transparency).
- **Why this score?** — expand one row, show base/social/features. *“Full transparency from FairScale’s API.”*
- **Policy templates** — when creating a round, show “Start from template” (Grant, Airdrop, Allowlist, DAO, Bounty).
- **Export JSON / Copy share link** — show collaboration without backend.

---

## Minute 3–4: Use cases

- Switch round type to **Airdrop**, then **Allowlist** (same flow, different label).
- *“One engine: grants, airdrops, allowlists, bounties, DAO, community access.”*
- **Export CSV** — show Round type, Rank, FairScore, Tier, Eligible, Suggested allocation, Risk.

---

## Minute 4–5: Vision + CTA

- **Closing line (memorable):** *“This is the execution layer for FairScore.”* Or: *“FairScore without Fair Allocator is a dashboard. Fair Allocator turns it into capital allocation.”*
- Show **For Judges · Traction**: rounds created, applicants scored, FairScore queries this session.
- **Live URL** and **Legends.fun (FAIRAT)** — “Vote us in futarchy — executable rep changes the game.”

## Production tips

- **Screen recording + voiceover**; zoom in on FairScore API responses and “Why this score?” breakdown.
- Emphasize **“No backend needed — deploy anywhere”** to show simplicity.
- Keep tone confident and data-backed; use FairScale stats at least twice.
