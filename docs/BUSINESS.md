# Fair Allocator — Business One-Pager

**One line:** Every airdrop, grant, and allowlist on Solana should default to FairScore. Fair Allocator is the fastest way to make that happen.

## Problem

Grant committees, airdrop operators, and ecosystem funds struggle to filter sybils from genuine builders. Manual review doesn’t scale; whitelists and airdrops are gamed. Without reputation-based filtering, funds and access go to low-quality or duplicate participants instead of real contributors.

## One product, multiple use cases (larger TAM)

Fair Allocator is **one reputation-based allocation engine** exposed as six round types. The same flow (add wallets → score with FairScale → rank → export) serves:

- **Grants** — committees allocating funds
- **Airdrops** — token distribution by credibility
- **Allowlists** — NFT/IDO spots by min score
- **Bounties** — payout priority by reputation
- **DAO** — governance eligibility or vote weight by FairScore
- **Community / events** — gated access by score

Multiple use cases mean a larger addressable market and more partnership surfaces (launchpads, DAOs, bounty platforms, event organizers) without rebuilding the product.

## Target audience

- **Grant operators** — committees running rounds (hackathons, ecosystem funds, DAOs)
- **Airdrop / launchpad teams** — fair token or allowlist distribution
- **Bounty platforms** — e.g. Superteam, Fairathon; rank and pay by reputation
- **Ecosystem funds** — Solana and web3 foundations allocating capital
- **Community / event organizers** — gated access by on-chain reputation

## Market context

- **Solana ecosystem:** 1M+ active wallets; hundreds of grant programs, airdrops, and DAOs allocating capital yearly. FairScale’s data (60%+ airdrops negative ROI, &lt;5% whitelist meaningful contribution) shows demand for reputation-based allocation is structural, not niche.
- **Competitor gap:** Manual tools (spreadsheets, Airtable) don’t integrate on-chain reputation; Fair Allocator automates ranking and allocation with FairScore in one flow.

## Revenue / sustainable value

| Tier | Features | Price |
|------|----------|--------|
| **Free** | Basic rounds (e.g. up to 50 applicants), CSV export, shareable links | $0 |
| **Pro** | Unlimited rounds, custom weights, batch export, priority support | $49–99/mo |
| **Enterprise** | API access, DAO integrations, white-label, governance module | $199+/mo |

- **Phase 1 (now):** Free public use; prove traction; Fair Allocator is the **execution layer for FairScore** — reputation middleware for capital allocation.
- **Phase 2 (3–6 months):** Pro tier; example: 50 hackathons/year × $199 ≈ $10k; 100 airdrop teams × $99 ≈ $10k.
- **Phase 3 (6–12 months):** Enterprise + **on-chain**: Solana program for score-gated minting, FairScore-based voting weight, airdrop distribution contract. Platform thinking; infrastructure defensibility.

## Strategy: first 100 / 1k / 10k users

| Stage   | Tactics |
|--------|---------|
| **First 100** | FairScale community, Superteam/Fairathon judges and operators, demo at Fairathon; word of mouth from early grant committees |
| **First 1k**  | Partnerships with 2–3 grant programs (Solana Foundation, major hackathons); case studies and “Powered by Fair Allocator” in their rounds |
| **First 10k** | Open-source adoption, integrations (Notion, Airtable, grant platforms), and optional white-label for large funds |

**3-month plan:** Week 1–4: X/Twitter + Fairathon/Legends.fun (FAIRAT) to reach 100 trial users; Month 2: Partner with 1–2 DAOs or bounty programs for pilot rounds; Month 3: Launch paid tier ($49–$199/mo) and publish case study.

## Evidence of demand

- **FairScale’s own data:** 60%+ of airdrops deliver negative ROI; 90% of tokens dumped within a week; &lt;5% of whitelist participants contribute meaningfully. Grant committees have the same problem: they need sybil-resistant scoring.
- **Grant committees** already spend time on manual checks; a tool that ranks by FairScore (on-chain + social) directly addresses “who do we fund?” with evidence, not guesswork.
