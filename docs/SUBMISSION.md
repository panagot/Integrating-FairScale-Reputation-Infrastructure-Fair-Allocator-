# Fairathon Submission Checklist

**Positioning:** Fair Allocator is the **execution layer for FairScore on Solana** — we transform FairScore into executable funding decisions (grants, airdrops, allowlists, bounties, DAOs, access control). **MVP choice:** Frontend-only for speed and simplicity; backend and on-chain enforcement in Phase 2 (see BUSINESS.md roadmap).

Use this list to ensure the Fair Allocator submission meets all requirements.
